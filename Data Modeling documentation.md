# RouteOptim Data Model Documentation

## Introduction

The "RouteOptim" project aims to enhance delivery efficiency for small businesses by optimizing delivery routes. This document provides a detailed overview of the data model, outlining the structure, relationships, and attributes of the database entities.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The ERD visually represents the entities within the system and their interrelationships.

## Notes

- Ensure that all foreign key relationships are properly indexed to maintain database integrity and optimize query performance.
- The `optimized_path` in the `routes` table should be structured in a format that can be easily parsed by the application for route reconstruction.

## 6. Set Up the Development Environment

For the development and testing of the **RouteOptim** system, the following steps were taken:

- **Database Management System**: 
  - We selected **PostgreSQL** for the database as it supports complex queries, constraints, and foreign key relationships, making it a good fit for the project.
- **Development Environment**: 
  - We used **Docker** to create isolated environments for development and testing, ensuring consistency across different stages of development.
  - A Docker container for the database was set up, and the environment was configured to ensure seamless deployment and testing.

---

## 7. Implement the Database Schema

Once the schema design was complete, we implemented it using the following steps:

- **SQL Commands**:
  - We wrote SQL commands to create the necessary tables and establish foreign key relationships.
- **Data Integrity**:
  - We applied constraints such as `NOT NULL` to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data.
  - Unique constraints were added to attributes like email in the `users` table to prevent duplicates.

---

## 8. Develop Application Logic

The next step was to implement the business logic of the **RouteOptim** system using the Django framework.

### Step 8.1: Create the Django Project and Application

We created a new Django project and application:

- **Django Project Setup**: 
  - We created a Django project named `delivery_management`.
- **Django Application**: 
  - A Django application was created inside the project folder named `delivery_management` to handle the delivery management functionalities.

### Step 8.2: User Registration View

To implement user registration, we created a registration view to handle both GET and POST requests for the user registration form. 

- **User Registration**: 
  - We used Djangoâ€™s built-in `UserCreationForm` to simplify user authentication and password management.
  - After successful registration, users are redirected to the login page, and a success message is displayed.

### Step 8.3: Set Up URLs for Registration

We added the URL pattern for the registration view:

- **URL Configuration**:
  - The route `/register/` is mapped to the `register` view we created.

### Step 8.4: Create Registration Template

We created the registration template for the user to enter their details:

- **Template Location**:
  - The registration template was placed in `templates/delivery_management/register.html`.
- **Form Fields**:
  - The page includes form fields to capture user information such as name, email, password, etc.

### Step 8.5: Static Files Setup for Styling

For the styling of the registration page, we configured static files:

- **CSS Styling**: 
  - A `style.css` file was created under the `static/css/` directory to style the registration page.
- **Static Files Configuration**: 
  - Static files were configured properly in the `settings.py` file by adding the `STATIC_URL` setting.

---

## Conclusion

At this stage, the **RouteOptim** system has a fully functional user registration page. Users can register their accounts, and the page is styled for better user experience. 

### Next Steps:

- **Login Functionality**: Implement login and authentication for users.
- **Password Reset**: Add functionality for password recovery.
- **Route Optimization**: Develop the route optimization logic to calculate the best delivery paths.
- **Delivery Management**: Implement the delivery tracking system to manage deliveries based on optimized routes.
